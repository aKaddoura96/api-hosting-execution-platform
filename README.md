# API Hosting & Execution Platform

A developer-first API marketplace and hosting platform where developers can host REST APIs or scripts (serverless-style), manage versions, and optionally sell access — with built-in billing, authentication, and analytics.

## Vision

**Three core value propositions:**
1. **Developers** get fast API hosting (like Vercel or Render)
2. **Consumers** get a marketplace of ready-to-use APIs (like RapidAPI, but simpler and regionally hosted)
3. **Platform** monetizes via usage fees, subscriptions, or transaction cuts

## Core Features

### 1. API Hosting & Execution
- Developers upload code (Python, Go, JS)
- System deploys as sandboxed container with auto-generated endpoint
- Each endpoint has:
  - `public_url` → accessible with API key/token
  - `private_url` → developer-only for internal/staging
  - Versioning (v1, v2, etc.)
  - Built-in request logging and analytics

### 2. Access Control
- **Public (Free)**: Anyone with API key can use
- **Private**: Developer or invited users only
- **Paid**: Subscription or per-call payment

### 3. Monetization Layer
- Usage-based billing: $0.01 per request or per minute
- Subscription model: $10/month for unlimited access
- Revenue split: Platform keeps 10-15% of sales
- MENA-friendly payment integration (Stripe/PayTabs/Moyasar/Network International)

### 4. Analytics & Dashboard
**Developer Dashboard:**
- Request counts, latency, error rates
- Earnings dashboard
- API keys management
- Logs and request samples

**Consumer Dashboard:**
- Usage statistics per API
- Billing and payment history

### 5. API Marketplace
- Public catalog with tags, docs, and pricing
- Categories: AI, NLP, finance, weather, etc.
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation integration

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (Next.js) — developer dashboards & public API marketplace
- Stripe/PayTabs integration for billing UI

**Backend:**
- Go (Golang) — orchestration, API gateway, billing logic
- PostgreSQL — user data, API metadata, billing, analytics
- Redis — caching + rate limiting
- Docker/Firecracker/gVisor — secure sandbox execution
- NATS or RabbitMQ — async job execution / logs streaming

**Hosting:**
- Kubernetes on AWS Dubai, G42 Cloud, or Azure UAE Central
- S3-compatible object storage for logs and code packages

## Execution Flow

1. Developer uploads script/API → validated → packaged into container → deployed
2. Platform assigns unique URL: `api.runspace.io/user/api-name/v1`
3. Request → API Gateway → routed to container → response
4. Request metadata stored (latency, usage)
5. Billing microservice calculates charges
6. Developer earnings credited, platform fee subtracted

## Differentiation

- **Arabic-first localization** — docs, billing, dashboard
- **UAE-hosted** — legal data residency compliance (banks/gov)
- **LLM/AI-focused** — host ML inference endpoints
- **Webhooks & automation** — integrate multiple APIs (Zapier-like layer)

## MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Core API Hosting
- [ ] Users upload code → gets REST endpoint
- [ ] Sandbox execution environment (Docker)
- [ ] Logs and analytics

### Phase 2 – Public/Private Access
- [ ] Auth system (JWT + API keys)
- [ ] Endpoint visibility toggle (public/private)

### Phase 3 – Billing & Marketplace
- [ ] Stripe/PayTabs integration
- [ ] Marketplace UI for browsing APIs
- [ ] Usage metering & developer payouts

### Phase 4 – Scaling & Multi-language Support
- [ ] Add Go, Node.js, Python runtimes
- [ ] Auto-scaling API containers
- [ ] Webhooks, cron jobs, long-running tasks
