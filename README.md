# API Hosting & Execution Platform

A project to host, route, and execute APIs/functions reliably with isolation, scalability, and observability.

## Core capabilities
- Endpoint routing and versioning
- Function execution with isolation (process/container/runtime pluggable)
- AuthN/Z, rate limiting, and quotas
- Job scheduling and async executions (queues)
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces
- Multi-tenant projects, environments, and secrets management

## Repository structure
- `src/` — service code and modules
- `docs/` — design docs and runbooks

## Getting started
- Define runtime(s) and execution model
- Implement minimal router and health endpoint
- Add storage/queue integrations and telemetry
